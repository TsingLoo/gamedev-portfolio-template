    <h3>Overview</h3> 
        <strong>The Verdant Revival</strong> is a survival game using Unity Engine. It is an adventure where the player steps into a world thatâ€™s gray and full of pollution. 
        Here, player's mission is to clean up the mess and turn the island from gray to green. 
        Do this by gathering trash, recycling it into handy items, and reviving tons of trees and plants.

        It was my individual courwork for CPT306-2223-S2-Principles of Computer Games Design.

        Here is the demo video of the prototype:

    <h3>Technical Insights</h3>
    <strong>The Verdant Revival</strong>'s UI Manager comes from my <a href="https://github.com/TsingLoo/TinyUFramework/tree/main"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg fa-fw"></i>TinyUFramework</a> and works well 
    with <a href="https://feel.moremountains.com/" target="_blank">FEEL</a> to load the scene and enhance interaction feedback. 
    It automatically registers the UI Panel prefabs in the asset folder and maintains their states to support the switch between different panels.
    <br>
    <br>
    The project uses the Burst Compiler to parallel the movements of blue cubes to simulate sea waves, getting a 2x performance boost rather than assigning a Monobehaviour to each cube to update its position in the main thread.
    The terrain is generated by Perlin Noise, and the nested ground cubes are removed to improve the performance further. The trees, rocks and toxics are distributed according to certain conditions (e.g., the trees are only generated on a 4x4 plain ground, and the corresponding ground will not instantiate toxics).
    <br>
    <br>
    Inspired by <a href="https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/">Zelda</a>, the game has a day-night cycle and the player's energy is demonstrated as a green ring.
    The energy will be recovered when the player is idle for a certain time and reduced when the player dashes. 
    The various feedbacks, screen effects and sounds are added to improve the overall feeling and experience.
